Plugin Hub requires an icon.png file (48x48 pixels).

You'll need to create or find an icon image for your plugin.
Suggested: A tears drop or Guthix symbol.

You can:
1. Create one at https://www.pixilart.com/ or similar
2. Find a royalty-free icon online
3. Extract from OSRS wiki (ensure it's allowed)

Save it as icon.png in this directory before submitting to Plugin Hub.
